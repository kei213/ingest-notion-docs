# Benefits

Mobile money offers more than just convenience. It provides a secure and efficient platform for various financial transactions, such as money transfers, bill payments, and online purchases.  It has many benefits for individuals, businesses, and the economy as a whole.

Here are some of the benefits of mobile money:

### Financial Inclusion

Opening a bank account can be challenging, especially for the unemployed, self-employed, or poor, as the required documents can be difficult to obtain. Mobile money has made it easy for anyone, regardless of employment or wealth status, to set up an account and benefit from this innovative technology.

The widespread adoption of mobile money has enabled individuals who did not have access to traditional banking services to become part of the formal financial system. Unlike traditional banking services, mobile money providers do not require customers to have a minimum balance in their account or meet any income requirements. This has made it possible for even low-income earners and those in the informal sector to access financial services, including savings and credit facilities. This has promoted financial inclusion and enhanced economic opportunities for individuals and communities.

### Convenience

Many transactions that are made through traditional banks require account holders to go in person to branches or ATM's which usually means travelling significant distances and waiting in long queues.

Registered users of mobile money do not have to deal with these issues because they can use their phone to transact wherever there is a phone signal and collect cash from nearby local agents. Mobile money agents can be found all over our villages, towns and cities. It is easy to find and get service from a nearby agent any time of the day. Your local street vendor or tuckshop is most probably an agent, no need to go far.

### Accessibility

Mobile money offers several advantages, including its simplicity and accessibility. Transactions can be easily carried out through a mobile device, making it a convenient and user-friendly option. Moreover, mobile money is accessible to individuals irrespective of their income or employment status. This has been particularly beneficial for individuals living in rural or remote areas, who may not have had access to traditional banking services.

### Low Fees and Quick Transactions

The fees are relativily low by comparison with those of traditional banks. There are no hidden charges that are taken from your account every month. A user is charged a small fee everytime they make a transaction and is informed how much it costs before approving the transaction.

Mobile money transactions are fast and secure. Users can send and receive money in the time it takes to send a sms.

### Safety

Mobile money services are provided and maintained by Mobile Network Operators who leverage their technological expertise and infrastructure to ensure that the services are secure and reliable. The service providers ensure the safety of their services by registering all agents and implementing strict regulations and operating procedures. Any agent found to be in violation of these regulations can be easily traced and held accountable.

Mobile money transactions are generally more secure than cash transactions as they are conducted electronically and require authorization through a PIN / secret code. In addition to this, mobile money services employ advanced security features such as encryption and authentication to protect against fraud and unauthorized access. As a result, users can trust that their money and transactions are secure when using mobile money services.

Furthermore the service providers are monitored by regulatory bodies such as the **Bank of Botswana** and **BOCRA.**
