# Get Started

## Requirements

To register and start using Orange Money, the following requirements need to be satisfied:

- You must be at least 16 years old
- Have a registered Orange Botswana Simcard and a working Mobile Phone
- Have a valid form of Identity verification: ID Card/Omang (for Batswana), Passport (for Foreign nationals)

## Open Account

Opening an Orange Money account is a straightforward process that can be completed at any authorized Orange Money agent or Orange Botswana shop. To begin, you will need to visit the location in person and ensure that you bring a valid form of identification and your mobile device (with your registered Orange Botswana SIM card inserted). During the registration process, you will be required to provide essential personal information, such as your full name, ID number, and address, as part of the necessary verification process.

Be assured that opening an account is a quick and hassle-free procedure, as there are no associated charges or fees involved. However, a minumum deposit of P5.00 into your account is required to start using the service.

## Secret Code

After completing the account opening process, you will be required to change the secret code. The default secret code provided is '0000', but for security reasons, it is necessary to change it to a code of your choice. Once you have successfully changed the secret code, your account will be activated, and you can start using the service.

Users are advised to never disclose their Secret Code/Pin to anyone, including Orange Botswana employees and Orange Money Agents !

*Watch out for scams and always be vigilant when using Orange Money*

## Visa Card

Once your account has been activated, we highly recommend applying for and acquiring the Orange Money Visa Card, which will be linked to your account. You can obtain the card immediately after activating your account or visit any Orange Money service point at a later date to inquire about obtaining one.

There is a cost associated with obtaining the card, usually around P35.00, but the exact price may vary slightly depending on the purchase location.
