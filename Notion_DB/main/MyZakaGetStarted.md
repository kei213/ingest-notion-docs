## Open MyZaka Account

Opening an MyZaka account is a straightforward process that can be completed at any authorized MyZaka agent or Mascom shop. To begin, you will need to visit the location in person and ensure that you bring a valid form of identification and your mobile device (with your registered Mascom SIM card inserted). During the registration process, you will be required to provide essential personal information, such as your full name, ID number, and address, as part of the necessary verification process.

Be assured that opening an account is a quick and hassle-free procedure, as there are no associated charges or fees involved. 

## MyZaka Secret Code / Pin

After completing the account opening process, you will be required to change the secret code. The default secret code provided is '0000', but for security reasons, it is necessary to change it to a code of your choice. Once you have successfully changed the secret code, your account will be activated, and you can start using the service.

Users are advised to never disclose their Secret Code/Pin to anyone, including Mascom employees and MyZaka Agents !

*Watch out for scams and always be vigilant when using MyZaka.*

## MyZaka Visa Card

Once your account has been activated, we highly recommend applying for and acquiring the MyZaka Visa Card, which will be linked to your account. You can obtain the card immediately after activating your account or visit any MyZaka service point at a later date to inquire about obtaining one.

There is a cost associated with obtaining the card, usually around P35.00, but the exact price may vary slightly depending on the purchase location
