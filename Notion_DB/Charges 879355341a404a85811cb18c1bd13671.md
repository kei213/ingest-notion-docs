# Charges

## Orange Money Pricing

Orange Money sets forth a pricing structure that prioritizes simplicity and transparency. There are no hidden fees, monthly account fees, or any fees that may leave you uncertain about their purpose.

You will only be charged when actively engaging in transactions and will be promptly notified of the transaction cost before authorizing it. Should you find the charges higher than expected, you have the option to cancel the transaction. If you choose to authorize the transaction, the fee will be immediately deducted from your account, providing you with a clear indication of your remaining balance.

This approach empowers you with complete control over your account expenditure, allowing you to manage your finances with confidence and make informed decisions about your transactions.
