## Keep Your Account Secure

Protecting your Mobile Money account is of utmost importance, and it starts with keeping your secret code and personal information confidential. Never share your secret code, or any other personal details with anyone. Ensure that your secret code is strong and unique, avoiding easily guessable information like your year of birth or consecutive numbers. Remember, a strong secret code acts as a crucial barrier against unauthorized access to your account.

In addition to securing your account, it is essential to prioritize the safety of your mobile device. Keep your device locked with a passcode to prevent unauthorized access. By maintaining a secure mobile device, you create an additional layer of protection for your account. 

Safeguarding your account and mobile device will ensure a safe and seamless experience with Mobile Money.

## Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant against scammers, as criminals may attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information. It is important to be aware of common scamming techniques and take necessary precautions to protect your mobile money account.

First and foremost, remember that the service providers will never ask for your secret code or any other personal details via phone calls, sms, or email. If you receive any communication requesting such information, treat it as suspicious and refrain from responding or providing any data.

Be cautious of calls, messages, or emails that seem unusual or unexpected. Scammers often employ tactics such as urgency, false promises, and lies to manipulate unsuspecting individuals. They may use sophisticated methods to make their communications appear genuine, such as pretending to be an employee of the service providers, creating fake websites or imitating official logos and branding.

When in doubt, it is always advisable to directly contact the official helpline of your mobile money service. They can verify the legitimacy of any communication you receive and provide guidance on how to proceed.

By staying alert, being cautious of suspicious requests, and seeking assistance from trusted sources, you can effectively protect yourself against scams and maintain the security of your account. Your vigilance is crucial in safeguarding your financial well-being.
