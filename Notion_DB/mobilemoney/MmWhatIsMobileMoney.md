## About Mobile Money in Botswana

Mobile money has been undergoing rapid growth, driven by improved access to technology and boosted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced people to turn to digital services as a safer transaction method than using cash. It has brought about a positive change to the economic life of Botswana residents who are now using it for a range of financial transactions, such as paying for goods in shops and sending money to loved ones.

The notable increase in the number of mobile money users prompted the Bank of Botswana to commence the regulation of mobile money services in 2020, through the implementation of the **[Electronic Payments Services Regulation.](https://www.bankofbotswana.bw/sites/default/files/press-release-files/press-release-eps.pdf)**

Mobile money has become a popular alternative to bank accounts for many people around the country. Here are some of the reasons why:

- **Easy to get started:** Registering an account and starting to use mobile money is an easy process with minimal requirements.
- **Simple and reliable to use:** Mobile money is simple and easy to use all while providing a reliable and secure user experience.
- **Provides convenience:** Mobile money allows people to make financial transactions using their mobile devices from anywhere at any time. This eliminates the need to carry cash or visit a physical bank.

Overall, these factors have contributed to the growing popularity of mobile money.

## ****How to use Mobile Money****

Setting up a mobile money account is easy, the first step is to register with a service of your choice (List of available services is shown above). This requires the user to go in person to an authorised Shop/Service point of their chosen service. The process is simple and only requires proof of identification and providing some basic personal information (e.g postal and residential address).

Once the account is set up, users can add funds to their mobile money account using various methods, such as depositing cash at a Mobile Money agent or transferring funds from a traditional bank account.

Users can then make transactions and manage their account through their mobile phone. Each mobile money service offers their customers the option to apply for and receive a Visa Debit Card linked to their account.

Users who have a Visa card can enjoy multiple benefits.

- The card can be used to withdraw cash from ATMs, providing users with easy access to their funds.
- In addition, the card can be used to make payments at point-of-sale terminals, allowing for seamless transactions at retail outlets, restaurants, and other merchants that accept Visa payments.
- Online transactions are also possible with the Visa card, enabling users to shop online and pay for goods and services from the comfort of their own homes. These benefits make the Visa card a versatile and valuable tool for those who use mobile money service.

Mobile money transactions are usually completed using USSD codes or an App.

- **App:** In order to conduct mobile money transactions through an app, a user must first download and install the application on their device. Additionally, internet connectivity is necessary to use the app for mobile money transactions.
- **USSD:** Using USSD codes is a more straightforward option. To access the USSD menu and log in to their mobile money account, the user needs to dial the USSD number of their respective mobile money service(e.g *123#) . Once logged in, the user can choose from various services such as checking their account balance, sending money, or purchasing airtime and data bundles.

Mobile money agents play a critical role in the functioning of mobile money services. They are the intermediaries between users and the mobile money service provider, facilitating transactions and ensuring that users can easily deposit and withdraw cash. Agents are typically small business owners, who are trained and authorized by the mobile money service provider to carry out transactions on its behalf.
